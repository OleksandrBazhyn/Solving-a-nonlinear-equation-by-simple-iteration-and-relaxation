# Solving-a-nonlinear-equation-by-simple-iteration-and-relaxation
The task is as follows:
Find the smallest negative root of the nonlinear equation
x^2+5sin(x)-1=0
by the method of simple iteration and relaxation with accuracy =10^-4.
Find the a priori and a posteriori estimate of the number of steps.
Choose the same initial interval and initial approximation for both methods (if possible), compare the results of the methods.
Develop a program that would perform the necessary and auxiliary calculations.
